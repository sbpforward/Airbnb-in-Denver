## Airbnb in Denver: This is Why We Can't Have Nice Things
### Sarah Forward

Background
------
I have been an Airbnb host in Denver for the last year and half. It's been a great source of mostly passive income and about 95% of our guests are pretty easy going. When I first discovered the data, I was interested in finding out:
+ Does the listing description and length increase number of bookings? 
+ What's the ratio of Superhosts to total Airbnb listings in Denver? 
+ Similar to optimizing SEO, do host's pack in Denver's things-to-do every chance they get?

...For example, I live in Sloan's Lake and two blocks from Mile High Stadium. That's included, but I also let guests know we're a shared-ride away from RiNo, LoHi, Coors Field, 16th Street Mall, the Convention Center etc.

+ There's a section called "Getting Around" on every listing where host's can tell guests what kind transporation options are available around the area. What are host's telling guests? More Uber mentions or Lyft? Are they proponents of the Light Rail? 

However, what started out to be a project to see how I could maximize and make more from my Airbnb listings quickly turned into fulfilling a childhood dream of become a real life "Harriet the Spy" after digging more into the data.
